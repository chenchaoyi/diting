# mdns-scanning Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change mdns-bonjour-discovery. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The `BonjourPoller` SHALL passively browse the well-known service-type list on the link-local mDNS multicast group
`BonjourPoller` SHALL subscribe via the Python `zeroconf` library's `ServiceBrowser` to a curated list of well-known service types (`_airplay._tcp`, `_raop._tcp`, `_googlecast._tcp`, `_sonos._tcp`, `_ipp._tcp`, `_ipps._tcp`, `_printer._tcp`, `_smb._tcp`, `_afpovertcp._tcp`, `_workstation._tcp`, `_hap._tcp`, `_homekit._tcp`, `_companion-link._tcp`, `_rfb._tcp`, `_ssh._tcp`, `_http._tcp`, `_https._tcp`, `_meshcop._udp`, `_matter._tcp`) maintained in `src/diting/data/bonjour_services.json`. The poller SHALL NOT browse the meta-type `_services._dns-sd._udp.local.` and SHALL NOT initiate any service-type discovery outside the curated list. The poller SHALL bind to all "up" network interfaces (the `zeroconf` library default) so the active Wi-Fi link and any other live interface produce announcements.

#### Scenario: AirPlay service announce captured
- **WHEN** an AppleTV on the same link emits an `_airplay._tcp` PTR / SRV / TXT announce
- **THEN** the poller's state map gains an entry keyed by `(service_type, instance_name)` with the announce's host, port, and TXT fields
- **AND** the next snapshot emitted by `BonjourPoller.events()` contains a corresponding `BonjourDevice`

#### Scenario: Unknown service type ignored
- **WHEN** a device on the link emits a `_my-vendor-custom._tcp` announce that is not in `bonjour_services.json`
- **THEN** the poller does NOT receive the event (because no browser is subscribed to that type)
- **AND** the snapshot list is unchanged

#### Scenario: No active probing across VLANs
- **WHEN** the poller starts up
- **THEN** it does NOT emit any unicast DNS queries to specific hosts
- **AND** it does NOT join the meta-discovery browse that would flood the link

### Requirement: `BonjourDevice` SHALL carry the announce-derived fields the panel renders
`BonjourDevice` SHALL be a frozen dataclass exposing these fields:

- `service_type: str` — the underscore-form type (e.g., `_airplay._tcp`).
- `name: str` — the service-instance name (e.g., `Living-Room-AppleTV`).
- `host: str | None` — the announced server (e.g., `Living-Room-AppleTV.local.`); None when the announce hasn't included one yet.
- `port: int | None` — the announced port.
- `addresses: tuple[str, ...]` — the announced IPv4 / IPv6 addresses (empty tuple if not yet resolved).
- `txt: dict[str, str]` — the parsed TXT record fields; UTF-8-decoded keys + values; binary-valued keys excluded.
- `vendor: str | None` — resolved via the chain in the next Requirement.
- `vendor_trace: str | None` — names which step of the resolution chain produced `vendor`. One of `txt-vendor`, `oui`, `hostname-pattern`, `service-type-hint`, or `None` when `vendor` is also `None`. Recorded by the resolver at the same time it produces `vendor`. Used by `bonjour-detail-modal` to annotate the Identity section so the user can see which signal won; used by maintainers to diagnose long-tail vendor-resolution gaps.
- `category: str | None` — the friendly service category from `bonjour_services.json` (e.g., `AirPlay` for `_airplay._tcp`); None for unknown types (cannot occur in v1 because unknown types are filtered out, but the field is included for forward-compatibility).
- `first_seen: datetime` — first announce observed (UTC).
- `last_seen: datetime` — most recent announce observed (UTC).

Field updates SHALL be applied per `(service_type, name)` key: a second announce for the same key updates `last_seen` and any newly-resolved field (addresses, port, TXT entries), but never replaces the device record.

#### Scenario: TXT record decoded UTF-8
- **WHEN** the announce includes a TXT entry `model=AppleTV3,2`
- **THEN** `BonjourDevice.txt["model"]` is the string `"AppleTV3,2"`

#### Scenario: Binary TXT field excluded
- **WHEN** the announce includes a TXT entry whose value bytes do not decode as UTF-8
- **THEN** that key is dropped from `BonjourDevice.txt`
- **AND** no exception propagates out of the parser

#### Scenario: vendor_trace records the winning chain step
- **WHEN** a device's vendor is resolved by the OUI step (step 2 of the chain)
- **THEN** `BonjourDevice.vendor_trace == "oui"`
- **AND** `BonjourDevice.vendor` is the non-None vendor name

#### Scenario: vendor_trace is None when the chain abstains
- **WHEN** all five steps abstain
- **THEN** both `BonjourDevice.vendor` and `BonjourDevice.vendor_trace` are `None`

### Requirement: `BonjourDevice.vendor` SHALL be resolved via a 5-step deterministic chain
The chain SHALL run in this order and SHALL return on the first step that produces a non-None vendor:

1. **TXT-record explicit field**: if `txt["vendor"]` or `txt["manufacturer"]` is present, that value is the vendor.
2. **OUI lookup**: if a TXT entry contains a MAC-formatted address (`xx:xx:xx:...`) OR a known MAC-bearing key (`deviceid`, `mac`), feed it through `ble.lookup_oui_vendor` and use the result.
3. **Hostname pattern**: feed `host` through the existing `_NAME_PATTERN_VENDORS` table in `ble.py` (`Apple-` / `HP-` / `Synology-` / `Sonos-` / `Roku-` patterns).
4. **Service-type vendor hint**: a small `_SERVICE_VENDOR_HINTS` table maps service types that uniquely identify a vendor (e.g., `_googlecast._tcp` → `Google`, `_sonos._tcp` → `Sonos`).
5. **Abstain**: return `None`.

#### Scenario: TXT vendor field wins
- **WHEN** a service announces `txt["vendor"] = "HomePod"`
- **AND** the hostname also matches the `Apple-` name pattern
- **THEN** `BonjourDevice.vendor == "HomePod"` (step 1 wins, step 3 never runs)

#### Scenario: Hostname pattern catches unbranded Apple device
- **WHEN** a service announces hostname `Macbook-Pro-2.local.` with no TXT vendor field and no MAC address
- **THEN** the chain falls through to step 3 and resolves vendor to `Apple, Inc.` via the `Macbook-` name pattern

#### Scenario: All steps abstain
- **WHEN** the announce has no TXT vendor, no MAC, an unrecognised hostname pattern, and an ambiguous service type (e.g., `_http._tcp` which any device may serve)
- **THEN** `BonjourDevice.vendor` is `None`
- **AND** the panel renders it as `(unknown)` / `(未知)`

### Requirement: The state map SHALL expire entries on `remove_service` callbacks AND fall back to a TTL when no remove is observed
The `ServiceListener` `remove_service` callback is the primary source of truth: when the library fires it, the entry SHALL be removed from the snapshot. Before applying the TTL backstop on each snapshot tick, the poller SHALL walk its state map and bump each entry's `last_seen` to `now` whenever zeroconf's DNS cache still holds any non-expired record for that service instance (looked up via `Zeroconf.cache.entries_with_name(name.lower())` filtered through `record.is_expired(now)`). This keeps the local TTL aligned with zeroconf's own record-cache lifetimes — a HomePod re-asserting an unchanged AirPlay record fires no `update_service` callback (zeroconf is change-driven), but zeroconf still holds the record in its cache and the poller SHALL treat the service as alive.

As a last-resort sweep for the rare case where zeroconf neither fires `remove_service` nor keeps the record cached (network change, library bug), the poller SHALL also expire entries whose `last_seen` is older than `_BROWSE_TTL_S` (default 300 seconds, exposed for tests). This default replaces the prior 60 s value — a 1-minute TTL was evicting most of a normal home network's mDNS surface because stable services (HomePods, printers, cameras) rarely change their announced info.

#### Scenario: Graceful disappearance
- **WHEN** `zeroconf` fires `remove_service` for a previously-announced service instance
- **THEN** the next snapshot does NOT include that `BonjourDevice`

#### Scenario: Stable service stays alive via cache liveness
- **WHEN** a HomePod re-announces the same AirPlay record every 30 s, so zeroconf does NOT fire `update_service` (the record's info is unchanged) and `last_seen` would otherwise stay frozen at the original `add_service` time
- **AND** zeroconf's DNS cache still holds at least one non-expired record for the service-instance name
- **THEN** the poller bumps the entry's `last_seen` to `now` on the next snapshot tick
- **AND** the entry SHALL NOT be evicted by the TTL backstop, regardless of how long the service has been silent at the callback layer

#### Scenario: Silent disappearance falls back to TTL
- **WHEN** a service stopped advertising and zeroconf's DNS cache no longer holds any non-expired record for the service-instance name
- **AND** `_BROWSE_TTL_S` (default 300 s) has elapsed since the last cache hit
- **THEN** the entry is removed from the snapshot at the next interval

#### Scenario: Cache-refresh is a no-op when the cache returns only expired records
- **WHEN** zeroconf's cache returns records for the service-instance name BUT every record reports `is_expired(now) == True`
- **THEN** the poller SHALL NOT bump `last_seen`; the entry's age is governed solely by the TTL backstop from this point

### Requirement: The `BonjourPanel` SHALL render the same vendor / name / services / age / id columns as the BLE panel
`BonjourPanel.compose()` SHALL build a `VerticalScroll` containing a `Static` body. The body SHALL render one row per `BonjourDevice` in `addresses`-then-name order, with columns (left to right): vendor (cyan when resolved, dim when `(unknown)`), name (white when present, dim italic when missing), service-category (cyan), age relative to "now" (dim), short id (first 8 chars of the service-instance name, dim). CJK column alignment SHALL use `pad_cells` / `fit_cells`.

There is NO RSSI column, NO signal-bar column, NO connected-vs-advertising split, NO history sparkline — the panel is simpler than `BLEPanel` because mDNS data doesn't carry signal-strength or per-device numeric series.

#### Scenario: AppleTV row rendered
- **WHEN** the panel receives a `BonjourDevice` with vendor=`Apple, Inc.`, name=`Living-Room-AppleTV`, category=`AirPlay`, last_seen 3 seconds ago
- **THEN** the row text contains `Apple, Inc.`, `Living-Room-AppleTV`, `AirPlay`, `3s`
- **AND** the columns are cell-aligned even when the user is running in ZH and a CJK character is present

#### Scenario: Unknown vendor row
- **WHEN** the panel receives a `BonjourDevice` whose vendor resolution chain abstained
- **THEN** the vendor cell renders as `(unknown)` / `(未知)` in dim style

### Requirement: The diagnostics panel SHALL surface an mDNS-side summary when the active view is `mdns`
When the user has the Bonjour view active, the Diagnostics panel SHALL replace its Wi-Fi-side lines with an mDNS summary:

1. **Visible Bonjour** — total service count + distinct service-type count.
2. **Top services** — three most-common service types with counts (e.g. `5 Apple Companion · 4 AirPlay · 4 AirPlay audio`).
3. **Top vendors** — three most-common vendor names with counts. The unknown-vendor bucket SHALL be rendered as `(unknown) N`, never as `? N`, to match the column placeholder used in the table and the same bucket's label in the BLE panel.
4. **Closest** — RSSI is not available on mDNS, so this line is omitted (BLE-only).

#### Scenario: User in mDNS view sees Bonjour diagnostics
- **WHEN** the user toggles to the `bonjour` view with 21 announces across 8 hosts
- **THEN** the diagnostics panel shows `Visible Bonjour 21 total · 7 service types`, `Top services …`, and `Top vendors …` rows

#### Scenario: Empty snapshot placeholder
- **WHEN** the user toggles to the `bonjour` view before any announce has arrived
- **THEN** the diagnostics panel shows a single dim-italic line `(listening for announces …)`

#### Scenario: Unknown-vendor bucket rendered with explicit label
- **WHEN** the snapshot has 16 announces from `Apple, Inc.` and 5 from devices whose vendor could not be resolved
- **THEN** the `Top vendors` line reads `Top vendors  16 Apple, Inc.  ·  (unknown) 5` — the literal `?` glyph SHALL NOT appear for this bucket

### Requirement: The poller SHALL clean up the underlying `zeroconf` resources on stop
`BonjourPoller.stop()` SHALL call `Zeroconf.close()` synchronously, joining any background threads the library started. The TUI's existing `on_unmount` SHALL invoke `BonjourPoller.stop()` alongside the existing `BLEPoller.stop()` call so processes exit cleanly without hanging.

#### Scenario: Clean shutdown
- **WHEN** the user quits the TUI with `q`
- **THEN** `BonjourPoller.stop()` is called
- **AND** the process exits within 1 second (no background threads keep it alive)

### Requirement: `zeroconf` dependency SHALL be lazy-imported at the module boundary and pre-warmed at TUI mount
`from zeroconf import ...` SHALL appear ONLY inside `src/diting/mdns.py` and SHALL be top-level inside that module (not function-local). `src/diting/tui.py` SHALL NOT `import diting.mdns` at module load.

The TUI SHALL trigger the first import of `diting.mdns` (and the construction of a `BonjourPoller`) at TUI mount — `App.on_mount` SHALL call `_ensure_mdns_poller()` after scheduling the other pollers. The pre-warm SHALL run on a worker (`run_worker` + `asyncio.to_thread` for the slow stages) so the visible Wi-Fi view renders immediately and the user's first ~5 s of reading the wifi panel amortises the zeroconf import + multicast socket setup. The `action_toggle_view` call into `_ensure_mdns_poller()` SHALL remain as an idempotent safety net but is a no-op once the mount-time prewarm has fired.

**Why mount-time instead of "first wifi → BLE"**: the PyInstaller-frozen binary's `PyiFrozenImporter` decompresses each imported module from a PYZ archive while holding the GIL throughout, so `asyncio.to_thread` cannot overlap the import with the event loop. The previous "first leaving Wi-Fi" trigger gave the frozen build only the ~2 s of BLE-view reading time to absorb a 1.5+ s import; with mount-time prewarm, the entire wifi-view dwell time is available. The source `uv run` build benefits too — the import overlaps with TUI initial paint instead of with a view switch.

#### Scenario: TUI mount kicks off the Bonjour prewarm
- **WHEN** the user launches the TUI
- **THEN** `App.on_mount` schedules a worker that imports `diting.mdns`, constructs a `BonjourPoller`, and begins the consumer task — all off the asyncio event loop
- **AND** the Wi-Fi panel renders immediately, with no perceptible pause attributable to Bonjour startup

#### Scenario: User cycles wifi → BLE → mDNS for the first time
- **WHEN** the user presses `n` once (wifi → BLE)
- **THEN** the BLE view appears immediately; the mount-time prewarm is either complete or in flight
- **WHEN** the user presses `n` a second time (BLE → mDNS)
- **THEN** the mDNS panel is shown immediately (the poller is ready since it has had the entire wifi-view dwell time to initialise)
- **AND** subsequent `n` cycles back to mDNS reuse the same poller (no re-instantiate)

#### Scenario: User never leaves Wi-Fi view
- **WHEN** the user runs `diting` and never presses `n`
- **THEN** zeroconf is still imported at mount (background worker), but no user-visible cost is incurred — the work happens concurrently with the user reading the wifi view
- **AND** no mDNS-related UI is shown

### Requirement: BonjourPoller socket setup SHALL run off the asyncio event loop
The synchronous `Zeroconf(...)` constructor inside `BonjourPoller._start_browser` opens a UDP multicast socket and joins 224.0.0.251:5353; this can take 100 – 500 ms on macOS. `BonjourPoller.events()` SHALL invoke `_start_browser` via `asyncio.to_thread` (not inline) so the asyncio event loop continues serving the TUI while the multicast handshake completes.

#### Scenario: Poller initialisation does not block the event loop
- **WHEN** the consumer task awaits the first iteration of `BonjourPoller.events()`
- **THEN** the underlying `Zeroconf(InterfaceChoice.Default)` call runs on a worker thread
- **AND** the asyncio event loop continues to process scheduled tasks (BLE poller, footer refresh, keystrokes) while the multicast socket setup is in flight

### Requirement: A crashed consumer task SHALL be re-startable by a subsequent `n` press
If the Bonjour consumer task exits via an unexpected exception (anything other than `asyncio.CancelledError` / `GeneratorExit`), it SHALL call `BonjourPoller.stop()` and reset `App._mdns_poller` to `None` so that the lazy-init gate in `_ensure_mdns_poller` no longer believes a poller is alive. A subsequent transition from Wi-Fi to BLE or BLE to mDNS SHALL rebuild the poller and restart the consumer.

#### Scenario: Consumer task hits an unexpected exception
- **WHEN** `BonjourPoller.events()` raises an unexpected exception inside the consumer task
- **THEN** the consumer task stops the poller, clears `App._mdns_poller`, and exits
- **AND** the TUI does not crash
- **WHEN** the user later cycles back through wifi → BLE
- **THEN** `_ensure_mdns_poller` rebuilds a fresh `BonjourPoller` and starts a new consumer task

### Requirement: The `BonjourPanel` SHALL support a `by-host` sort mode in addition to the default service-row mode
The Bonjour panel SHALL accept two sort modes:

- `service` (default) — one row per `(host, service_type)` pair. Each row's services column carries a single service-type name. This is the historical behaviour.
- `by-host` — one row per `host`. The vendor / name / age / host columns reflect the host's most-recent service announce. The services column folds the host's services into a comma-joined string of the short service-type names (e.g. `AirPlay, AirPlay audio, Apple Companion, HomeKit`), in alphabetical order of the short name. Long folded lists SHALL be truncated to the column width with an ellipsis via `fit_cells` (no raw slicing — keep CJK-safe).

The user SHALL cycle between modes via the existing `s` keystroke. The cycle order is `service` → `by-host` → `service`. The border subtitle's `sort: <mode>` SHALL reflect the current mode.

The `service` mode is the default on TUI start. Switching modes does not refetch — both modes operate on the same `BonjourDevice` snapshot.

#### Scenario: User on Bonjour view presses `s`
- **WHEN** the view is `bonjour`, current sort is `service`, and the user presses `s`
- **THEN** the panel re-renders in `by-host` mode and the border subtitle reads `sort: by-host`

#### Scenario: User presses `s` again
- **WHEN** the view is `bonjour` and current sort is `by-host`
- **THEN** the panel re-renders in `service` mode and the border subtitle reads `sort: service`

#### Scenario: HomePod with four services
- **WHEN** in `by-host` mode and a host `Blue-Pod` has services `_airplay._tcp`, `_raop._tcp`, `_companion-link._tcp`, `_homekit._tcp`
- **THEN** the row's services column reads `AirPlay, AirPlay audio, Apple Companion, HomeKit` (alphabetically sorted short names, comma-joined)

#### Scenario: by-host mode collapses count
- **WHEN** in `service` mode the panel reports `21 services` from `8` hosts, then the user presses `s`
- **THEN** `by-host` mode shows `8` rows; the border subtitle's `Nearby Bonjour devices` count reflects the row count in the active mode

#### Scenario: Long services list truncates with ellipsis
- **WHEN** a host has 7 services and the joined string would overflow the column
- **THEN** the rendered string is truncated to the column width with a trailing `…` via `fit_cells`, never via raw `str` slicing
